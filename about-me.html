                <p class="body-md-r zest">I’m a UX generalist with a particular passion for the small details. I’ve
                    spent the
                    last
                    few years creating workflow-centric, web-based software for a variety of financial products, ranging
                    from ETL, front-office dashboards, and everything inbetween. My UX career started after completing a
                    Masters in Human-computer Interaction, prior to which I was an Industrial Designer working in
                    London.</p>

                <p class="body-md-r zest">What's ΩHM? I'd love to say something poetic about how ohms are a measure of
                    (electrical) resistance and how UX designers are always pushing through product and corporate
                    contraints, achieving the best we can no matter the obsticles...the reality however is much more
                    boring; O H M are just my initials.</p>

                <p class="body-md-r zest">I’m a total geek at heart and love spending my time cooking, tinkering,
                    reading
                    Sci-fi
                    and comics. Oh! And hyper-fixating on various shortlived hobbies. Ask me how my
