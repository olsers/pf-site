				<h2>Work stuff</h2>
				<p>I’m a UX generalist with a particular passion for the small details. I’ve
					spent the
					last
					few years creating workflow-centric, web-based software for a variety of financial products, ranging
					from ETL, front-office dashboards, and everything inbetween. My UX career started after completing a
					Masters in Human-computer Interaction, prior to which I was an Industrial Designer working in
					London.</p>
				<p>My résumé can be found on
					<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/oliverhmason/">LinkedIn</a>.

				<p>What's ΩHM? I'd love to say something poetic about how ohms are a measure of
					(electrical) resistance and how UX designers are always pushing through product and corporate
					contraints, achieving the best we can no matter the obsticles...the reality however is much more
					boring; O H M are just my initials.</p>
				<h2>What makes me tick</h2>
				<p>I’m a total geek at heart and love spending my time cooking, tinkering,
					reading
					Sci-fi
					and comics. Oh! And hyper-fixating on various shortlived hobbies. Ask me how my
					<span>leatherworking</span>&ensp;
					<span>keyboard-designing</span>&ensp;
					<span>breadmaking</span>
					3D printing is going!
